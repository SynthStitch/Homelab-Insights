System & Developer Instructions Summary:
- System: You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI.
- Developer: Operate as Codex coding agent; prefer `rg`, follow editing constraints, use planning tool judiciously, avoid destructive git commands, follow presentation formatting rules.

Conversation Timeline Highlights:
1. Mini-project-2: switched from simulated to live Proxmox data via API token, created pass-through controller/route, polled every 15s, mirrored Module-9 controller format, and set up MongoDB storage.
2. Added CRUD brainstorming for VM visibility per user, modeled MongoDB schema/SQL equivalent, discussed RBAC assignments, and integrated live dashboard data (nodes + VMs).
3. UI polish: hooked landing metrics to live feed, added load-average tooltip, network column review, memory discrepancy debugging, D3 hover lens, WavyBackground + EncryptedText hero, TiltCard components, hover lines vs circles, MUI styling consideration, and option to toggle tilt for heavy VM lists.
4. Presentation prep: reviewed professor feedback (clear Three.js blurb, architecture + user-flow diagrams, metric rationale, sharper screenshots), drafted business context, user stories, next steps, and emphasized "fancy graphs" value prop.
5. Sign-in page refinements: replaced Three.js background with Aceternity BackgroundBoxes, removed overlapping headings, ensured background brightness, noted possibility to feature-flag backgrounds.
6. Mini-project-3 focus: DashboardPage.css had orphaned declarations; replaced with working version and removed dangling block to clear 70 lint errors.

Outstanding Notes:
- Consider cleaning unused Three.js hook and Tailwind CDN warning before production.
- Future steps: finalize RBAC CRUD UI, alerting thresholds, Mongo snapshot analytics, and slide diagrams.
